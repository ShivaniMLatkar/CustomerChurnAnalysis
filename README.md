Abstract:
The increasingly competitive telecommunications industry in the present day world has caused each network provider in the market to spend millions of dollars in research for predicting churn rates and devising targeted methods to boost their customer retention. Retaining loyal customers has become one of the prime objectives of these companies in order to survive, grow and increase their profits. However, predicting customer churn rate is a complex task which involves analyzing the effect of multiple factors. Our project aims to address this challenge by leveraging a comprehensive range of machine learning classification models to predict customer loyalty. We evaluate the following machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, and Soft and Hard Voting Classifier (Ensemble techniques). A Telecom customer dataset has been obtained from Kaggle platform and each model will be trained, tested and its performance will be analyzed thoroughly. The results from this project would give the best optimized machine learning model that could be scaled and utilized by companies for maximising their customer retention.
